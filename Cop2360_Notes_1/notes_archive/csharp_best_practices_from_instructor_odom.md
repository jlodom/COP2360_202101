A Few Things Instructor Odom Says All The Time About C# and Programming
=======================================================================

1. The computer exists to do work that we do not want to do, or do work faster, or to do it over and over. Your programs should be for this purpose.

2. All methods should always return, and fail safe.
3. Exceptions should be used to fail safe and should never be unhandled.
3A. Exceptions are not necessary if the code can simply handle all cases.
3B. Use try blocks for stretches of code where many different things can go wrong in close proximity.
4. Do not use var unless you really mean it. Take advantage of C#'s strong typing.
5. Use /* Comments */ for long-term comments and // for comments you will erase later.
6. No variable created by your program should ever be null when in use.
